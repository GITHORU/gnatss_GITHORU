# Welcome to the Offshore Geodesy Project

Near-Trench Community Geodetic Experiment is a five-year NSF-funded project that will establish open and accessible seafloor deformation data offshore Alaska and Cascadia,
in regions responsible for some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis ever recorded.

A part of this overall project is to develop an open-source code for the processing of GNSS-Acoustic data for seafloor horizontal positioning.
The software is a redevelopment of existing FORTRAN codes and shell scripts developed by C. David Chadwell for processing data including measurements made with Wave Gliders.
Existing code, which includes proprietary routines, is developed and maintained by John DeSanto.
